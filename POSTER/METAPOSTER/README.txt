The Metaposter is realized in TeX.

TO DO
1. put your glyphs into the Metafont file glyphs.mf
2. put the global parameters (space, etc) of the font in the Metafont file fontname.mf
3. write your layout in a file filename.tex
4. Start script with 'python makepdf.py' (change the name of the file!) 
5. TADAMM
6. open filename.pdf


If there is a mistake somewhere, control z will stop the script so that you can correct it and start again!

Pens

Some pens:
- pensquare
- pencircle
- ...

From "Fun with Metafont" (Hans Haagen):

'Pens are very important when defining fonts, and METAFONT is meant to be a font creation tool.
Since METAPOST has a slightly different audience, it lacks some features in this area, but offers a
few others instead. Nevertheless, one can try to design a font using METAPOST. Of course, pens are
among the designers best kept secrets. But even then, not every O is a nice looking one.'

       patch  takes  a  patch file patchfile containing a difference listing produced by
       the diff program and applies those differences to one  or  more  original  files,
       producing  patched  versions.   Normally the patched versions are put in place of
       the originals.  Backups can be made; see the -b or --backup option.  The names of
       the  files  to  be  patched are usually taken from the patch file, but if there's
       just one file to be patched it can be specified on the command line as  original‐
       file.

        Upon  startup,  patch  attempts to determine the type of the diff listing, unless
       overruled by a -c (--context),  -e  (--ed),  -n  (--normal),  or  -u  (--unified)
       option.   Context  diffs (old-style, new-style, and unified) and normal diffs are
       applied by the patch program itself, while ed diffs are simply fed to  the  ed(1)
       editor via a pipe.

       patch  takes  a  patch file patchfile containing a report of contacterence listing produced by
       the report of contact program and applies those report of contacterences to one  or  more  original  files,
       producing  patched  versions.   Normally the patched versions are put in place of
       the originals.  Backups can be made but are they really useful?  The names of
       the  files  to  be  patched are usually taken from the patch file, but if there's
       just one file to be patched it can be specified on the command line as  original‐
       file.

        Upon  startup,  patch  attempts to determine the type of the report of contact listing, unless
       overruled by a -c (--context),  -e  (--ed),  -n  (--normal),  or  -u  (--unified)
       option.   Context  report of contacts (old-style, new-style, and unified) and normal report of contacts are
       applied by the patch program itself, while ed report of contacts are simply fed to  the  ed(1)
       editor via a pipe.
